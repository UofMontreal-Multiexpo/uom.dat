# Occupational Exposure Databases analysis tools - Multiexposure


## Project purpose

This project is about developing **R processing, analysis and visualization tools** for occupational exposure databases, especially for multiexposure.

The development of these tools is part of a research study led by **Jérôme Lavoué** (Professor at [**University of Montreal**](https://recherche.umontreal.ca/english/home/), department of environmental health and occupational health) whose title is "Portrait of multiexposure situations in the workplace in Quebec from occupational exposure databases".

Main analytical approaches are *Frequent Itemset Mining*, *Association Rules*, *Clustering* and *Spectrosome*.


## Documentation

In addition to the documentation of the functions included in the **man** folder, the **vignettes** folder contains:

* An example of analysis, presented in the file `spectral_analysis_example.nb.html`.

* A presentation of the data structures used by the `SpectralAnalyzer` class (attributes, function parameters and function returns) in the  file `Attribute_and_method_types.pdf`.
