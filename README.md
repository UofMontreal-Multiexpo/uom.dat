# Occupational Exposure Databases analysis tools - Multiexposure


## Purpose

This project is about developing **R processing, analysis and visualization tools** for occupational exposure databases, especially for multiexposure.

The development of these tools is part of a research study led by **Jérôme Lavoué** (Professor at [**University of Montreal**](https://recherche.umontreal.ca/english/home/), department of environmental health and occupational health) whose title is "Portrait of multiexposure situations in the workplace in Quebec from occupational exposure databases".

Main analytical approaches are *Frequent Itemset Mining*, *Association Rules*, *Clustering* and *Spectrosome*.


## Installation

To install the package **oedb.analysis.tools**:

1. Clone the repository or download a ZIP copy.
2. In RStudio, open the project file `oedb-analysis-tools.Rproj`.
3. Go to the "Build" tab (which is by default in the upper right quadrant).
4. Click on the "Install and Restart" button.


## Documentation

In addition to the documentation of the package, data and functions (accessible by the `help` function), the **doc** directory contains:

* An example of analysis, presented in the file `spectral_analysis_example.nb.html`.

* A presentation of the data structures used by the **SpectralAnalyzer** class (attributes, function parameters and function returns) in the file `Types_of_attributes_and_methods.pdf`.

These files can be accessed using `help(package = "oedb.analysis.tools")` then clicking on "User guides, package vignettes and other documentation".
