\title{Computation of the Reporting Index (RI)}
\usage{
\S4method{compute_reporting_indexes}{SpectralAnalyzer}(object, patterns, t = NULL, period = Inf)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{S4 object of class \code{SpectralAnalyzer}.}

\item{patterns}{Patterns whose reporting indexes are to be computed.}

\item{t}{Year of the end of the period, i.e. the date on which to characterize the patterns.
\code{NULL} specifies that the characterization must be done in relation to the last year covered
by the observations.}

\item{period}{Time interval over which to compute the reporting indexes (number of years).
For example, if \code{t = 2019} and \code{period = 9} then the computation is made over the
period [2011 - 2019].

\code{Inf} specifies that the period considered covers an interval starting on the date of the
oldest observation and ending in the year \code{t}.}
}
\value{
Vector containing the reporting index of each pattern contained in \code{patterns}.
}
\description{
Compute the reporting index of each pattern for a given period.
This index provides information on the proportion and importance of the occurrences of a pattern,
 taking into account the occurrences of the other patterns.
}
\details{
\loadmathjax
The reporting index of the pattern \eqn{p} given by:
 \mjdeqn{RI_p(t_1,t_0) = \frac{\sum_{t = t_0}^{t_1} W_{p,t}}{\sum_{q \in P} \sum_{t = t_0}^{t_1} W_{q,t}}}{RI_p(t_1,t_0) = sum W_pt from t = t_0 to t_1 / sum W_{q,t} for q in P and from t = t_0 to t_1}
where \eqn{P} is the set of patterns, \mjeqn{W_{p,t}}{W_pt} is the weight of the pattern \eqn{p} in
 the observations of the year \eqn{t}, \mjseqn{t_0} and \mjseqn{t_1} are the first and last years
 defining the period on which to compute the reporting index.
