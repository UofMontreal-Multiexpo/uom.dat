#' The missed toxicity of the vector \eqn{i} is given by:
#'  \mjdeqn{Missed~toxicity_i = 1 - \frac{1}{MCR_i}}{Missed toxiciy_i = 1 - 1 / MCR_i}
#'  where \eqn{MCR} denotes the maximum cumulative ratio.
#' \cr
#' In the specific case where all values of the vector (or the corresponding \eqn{HI} and \eqn{MHQ})
#'  are equal to \eqn{0}, the resulting missed toxicity is \eqn{0}.
