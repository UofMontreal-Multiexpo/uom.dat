#' @section Warning:
#' 
#' Several versions of the package `ggraph` experience some issues about
#'  hierarchical edge bundling charts.
#' Such charts are created by the functions `co_occurrence_chart` and
#'  `rules_chart`.
#' The correct operation of these functions has been validated with the
#'  version 2.0.5 of `ggraph`. Therefore, we recommend the use of this version.
#' To install it, run the following instruction.
#' \preformatted{
#' remotes::install_version("ggraph", version = "2.0.5")
#' }
